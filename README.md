# Train-Scheduler

* The train scheduler is a web application that uses Firebase to host arrival and departure data. It provides up-to-date information about the trains in the database, including their arrival time and how many minutes until their arrival. You can add your own train too! Just fill out the form at the bottom of the page, and after you hit submit, your train and its next arrival will appear in the table at the top of the page.

* This project uses HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, Firebase, and Moment.js
